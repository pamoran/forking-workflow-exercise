# Cauliflower tacos

This recipe is taken as an example from https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy/blob/master/full_tacos/cauliflower_tacos.md.

We are avid meat eaters, but these vegetarian tacos are one of our go-tos in
Peru. If you can make the pickles with Peruvian aji amarillo, please do.

- Roast cauliflower
- Pickled chilis and vegetables
- Caramelized red onions
- Guacamole
- Yogurt
- Tortilla of choice, warmed in a dry pan

Cook cauliflower in 10-inch skillet over medium heat 8 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until gold; drain.

Heat taco shells as directed on package. Serve taco shells with cauliflower mixture with guacamole, vegetables and chilli of choice.
