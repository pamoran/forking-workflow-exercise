    * Prepare – Line a baking sheet with paper towels and set a medium or large skillet with 1/4-inch of oil over medium heat. 
    * Have some kosher salt nearby in a pinch bowl.
    * Fry the tortillas – When the oil reaches 350ºF, slide in a tortilla and fry for 12 to 15 seconds, or until it’s golden and bubbly. 
    * Flip and use tongs to fold the tortilla in half, cooking 10 to 12 seconds on each side, or until golden brown.
    * Drain and season – Use the tongs to transfer the finished shell to the paper-towel-lined baking sheet and season with kosher salt immediately after frying so it sticks nicely to the taco shell. 
    * Repeat – Repeat the process with the remaining tortillas.
